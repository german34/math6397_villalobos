#Generate a random 100 by 100 matrix, whose entries are samples from a normal distribution
#Plot the distribution of singular values in a box-and-whisker plot.
#Plot the mean and median singular values as a function of r.

#Now repeat this for different matrix sizes
#Ex: 50by50, 200by200, 500by500, 1000by1000
