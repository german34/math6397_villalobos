Exercise 1.3
'''

#Load the Yale B image data base and compute the economy SVD using a standard svd command

#Compute the SVD with the method of snapshots

#Compare the singular value spectra on a log plot.
#Compare the first 10 left singular vectors using each method
#(remember to reshape them into shape of a face).

#Now compare a few singular vectors farther down the spectrum.
#Explain your findings
